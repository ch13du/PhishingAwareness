# Email Header Analysis

Email headers provide critical information about the email's origin and path. Key headers include:
- **From**: The sender's address (often spoofed in phishing emails).
- **To**: The recipient.
- **Subject**: The subject line (may use urgency to trick the victim).
- **Received**: Shows the servers the email passed through (check for anomalies).
